# Anthropic API (for Uniform Recognition feature)
# Required for Claude Vision API to analyze police uniforms, equipment, and insignia.
# Used to identify UK police forces (Met, City of London, BTP), tactical units (TSG, FIT),
# rank insignia (chevrons, pips), and equipment (shields, batons, body cameras).
# Get your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
# Cost: ~$0.015 per image analysis (Claude claude-sonnet-4-20250514 with vision)

# Uniform Analysis Settings
# Controls whether uniform analysis runs automatically during video/image processing.
# When 'true': Every detected officer is automatically analyzed via Claude Vision API.
#              This provides comprehensive data but increases API costs significantly.
# When 'false': Analysis is on-demand only via the /appearances/{id}/analyze endpoint.
#               Recommended for cost control - users manually trigger analysis as needed.
# Default: false (to prevent unexpected API charges)
ENABLE_AUTO_UNIFORM_ANALYSIS=false

# Rate limit for uniform analysis API calls (requests per minute).
# Prevents excessive API usage and helps control costs during batch processing.
# Lower values (5-10): Safer for cost control, slower processing
# Higher values (20-30): Faster processing, higher potential costs
# Note: Claude API has its own rate limits; this is an additional application-level limit.
# Default: 10 (balanced between speed and cost control)
UNIFORM_ANALYSIS_RATE_LIMIT=10
